# Fraud Detection Model Development

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a robust machine learning model to predict fraudulent transactions for a financial company. By analyzing transaction data and leveraging advanced statistical techniques, we will create an actionable plan to detect and prevent fraud effectively.

## Instructions

Develop a solution for the provided business case using the dataset. Follow standard model development procedures, focusing on statistical analysis and creativity/judgment.

### Submission Requirements:
- Updated Resume (maximum 2 pages)
- Jupyter Notebook with your solution

### Eligibility Criteria:
- Only college/university graduates or final semester students are eligible.
- Graduates must have a minimum aggregate of 60% passing grade.

## Business Context

We need to predict fraudulent transactions using a dataset containing 6,362,620 rows and 10 columns. The goal is to use insights from the model to develop an actionable fraud prevention plan.

### Data Dictionary & Source
- **Data Dictionary:** Detailed descriptions of the dataset columns can be found [here](#).
- **Dataset:** The dataset can be downloaded [here](#).

## Candidate Expectations

Your task is to execute the process for proactive fraud detection while addressing the following key areas:

1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Handle missing values, outliers, and multi-collinearity to ensure data quality.

2. **Model Development:**
   - Describe the fraud detection model you developed, including algorithms used and why.

3. **Feature Selection:**
   - Explain your methodology for selecting the most relevant variables.

4. **Model Performance:**
   - Demonstrate the performance of your model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. Include visualizations where applicable.

5. **Key Predictive Factors:**
   - Identify the key factors that predict fraudulent transactions.

6. **Factor Validation:**
   - Discuss whether these factors make sense based on your analysis and domain knowledge.

7. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Suggest infrastructure and process improvements for fraud prevention.

8. **Evaluation of Measures:**
   - Explain how you would assess the effectiveness of the implemented fraud prevention actions.

## Conclusion

By addressing these points, you will develop a comprehensive fraud detection model that not only identifies fraudulent transactions but also helps the financial company strengthen its defenses against fraud. Continuous assessment and improvement will ensure the system's resilience against evolving threats.
